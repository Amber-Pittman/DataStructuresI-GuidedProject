### Stacks

1. A stack is a data structure that literally mimics a stack of papers on your desk. 
2. Linear
3. Last In, First Out (LIFO)
4. Like a stack of papers on your desk. If we have a stack of papers on our desk, what do we need to be able to with that stack of papers?
  * Put an item on the top
  * Take an item off the top
  * Or just look at what's on top of the desk without actually taking it off the desk.
5. Example Operations:
  * **push(item)** - adding an item to the top of the stack
  * **pop()** - removing the item on the top of the stack; typically returns the item that is removed
  * **peek()** - returns the value of the item on the top of the stack without removing it
6. All stack operations take O(1) time.


### Queues

1. Queues are like checkout lines at the grocery store. 
2. Also linear
3. First In, First Out (FIFO)
4. Example Operations:
  * **enqueue(item)** - adding an item to the end of the queue
  * **dequeue()** - removing the item at the beginning of the queue; typically returns the item that is removed
5. All queue operations also take O(1) time.
